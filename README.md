# Sports Analytics and Machine Learning - Project overview
 FIFA 19 is a soccer game released by EA Sports.

In this project, I have performed various data-cleaning techniques , Data-Visualization techniques and Machine Learning algorithms.
Going through this project you will recognize the "Data Science Project-from scratch" ideology and would help you understand some of the core steps involved
in as Data Science project.


# Summary of Sports Analytics Project
- Created a recommendation tool with (KNN Model) for Team manager to scout for suitable replacement of a player , during a transfer market opening
- Preformed Data Cleaning techniques on 20000 player dataset , including all the attributes of the players with reference to their preferred position
- Optimzed Logistic regression, Decision tree Model and KNN model using GridsearchCV to reach the max model accuracy.
- Performed Binning or quantization methodology to reduce the categorical variable in the dataset, which in turn are useful for Machine Learning
